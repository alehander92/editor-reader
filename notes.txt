tried:

orca on linux:

* ok for shell, reads a bit too much, seems to have strange numpad up/down arrow handling/overloading? normal ones seem to work fine
* not working mostly for sublime
* working mostly for vim, but can have more programming language-aware logic/context detailed reading/indent/syntax help

looked a bit through espeak and speechd
  can set languages and pauses with ,

todo

* write a simple vim/nvim plugin or vscode plugin if more practical/easier
  * detect actions and read using parser/tokens or tree-sitter
  * detect special shortcuts and re-read context or in different mode
  * use it ourself for some tasks/testing
  * eventually try to port for other editor: vscode? maybe sublime?
  * somehow make it possible to easily test for outsiders: personally or with easier instructions
  * try to find users like mariana/slavi/online people or others for opinion/test?
  * prepare for showing, maybe try to generalize a bit for shell or using some kind of lib? so at least some parts are reusable?

try vscode with orca and eventually other / windows?

maybe integrate/pr into orca?
or base on it?
or at least show them/other people?

orca can use the numpad for going around and re-reading

maybe try some windows reade
